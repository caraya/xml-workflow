Even large vocabularies like [Docbook](http://docbook.org) are limited in what they can do out of the box. HTML4 is non-extensible and HTML5 is limited in how you can extend it (web components are the only way to extend HTML5 I'm aware of that doesn't require an update to the HTML specification.)</p><p>By creating our own markup vocabulary we can be as expressive as we need to be without adding additional complexity for writers and users and without adding unecessary complexity for the developers building the tools to interact with the markup.</p><p>It has been suggested that
      <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/" label="Pandoc">Pandoc</a> may be a better alternative than rolling your own markup and style sheet sets. While Pandoc is a very powerful tool it tries to do too much for too many. See the website for a list of formats Pandoc supports:</p><p>My problems with Pandoc are:</p><ul>
      <li>You can only convert your content to PDF if you have LaTex installed. Even a minimal LaTex library requires a fairly large install</li>
      <li>LaTex installs are different for Macintosh, Windows and Linux. This makes a uniform support system impossible</li>
      <li>If you want to add custom formats you have to do so in Lua. I'd rather not learn another programming language just for one project</li>
    </ul><h2>Why create our own markup</h2><p>Rather than figure out how to use someone else tool for this proof of concept I've decided to build my own markup vocabulary and explore XML, XSL and CSS as the tools to create HTML and print-ready content.</p><p>Using XSL and CSS to manipulate XML content reduces the number of external dependencies. As it stands right now, the project depends on
      <a href="http://www.saxonica.com/welcome/welcome.xml" label="Saxon">Saxon</a> to convert XML to HTML and
      <a href="http://www.princexml.com/" label="PrinceXML">PrinceXML</a></p><p>In creating your own xml-based markup you enforce separation of content and style. The XML document provides the basic content of the document and the hints to use elsewhere. XSLT stylesheets allow you to structure the base document and associated hints into any number of formats (for the purposes of this document we'll concentrate on XHTML, PDF created through Paged Media CSS and PDF created using XSL formatting Objects)</p><p>It reduces the ammount of external code that we have to adapt in order to acomplish a given task.</p><p>Creating a domain specific markup vocabulary allows you think about structure and complexity for yourself as the editor/typesetter and for your authors. It makes you think about elements and attributes and which one is better for the given experience you want and what, if any, restrictions you want to impose on your makeup.</p><p>By creating our own vocabulary we make it easier for authors to write clean and simple content. XML provides a host of validation tools to enforce the structure and format of the XML document.</p><h2>Options for defining the markup</h2><p>For the purpose of this project we'll define a set of resources that work with a book structure like the one below:</p><pre><code class="xml hljs">&lt;book&gt;
  &lt;metadata&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;The adventures of SHerlock Holmes&lt;/title&gt;

    &lt;author&gt;
      &lt;first-name&gt;Arthur&lt;/first-name&gt;
      &lt;surname&gt;Connan Doyle&lt;/surname&gt;
    &lt;/author&gt;
  &lt;/metadata&gt;

  &lt;section type="chapter"&gt;
    &lt;para&gt;Lorem Ipsum&lt;/para&gt;
    &lt;para&gt;Lorem Ipsum&lt;/para&gt;
  &lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/book&gt;
    </code></pre><p>It is not a complete structure. We will continue adding elements afte we reach the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) stage. As usual, feedback is always appreciated.</p></section></body></html>
