## Influences

**[Docbook 5.1: The Definitive Guide](http://docbook.org/tdg51/en/html/)** 

Docbook was one of my biggest influences and it's a big influence on how the schema is structured and how the stylesheets interact.

## Creating CSS Paged Media Resources

**[Building books with css3](http://alistapart.com/article/building-books-with-css3)**

## HTMLBooks

For another example, see: [HTMLbook stylesheet to generate pdf](https://github.com/oreillymedia/HTMLBook/blob/master/stylesheets/pdf/pdf.css) which is the basis for this project.

## Paged Media Specifications

For the W3C specifications: [Paged Media level 3](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-page/) and [Generated Content for Paged Media](http://www.w3.org/TR/css-gcpm-3/)
