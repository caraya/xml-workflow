         <h1>Task Automation with Grunt</h1>
         <p>Because we use XML we can't just dump our code in the browser or the PDF viewer we
            need to prepare our content for conversion to PDF before we can view it. There are
            also front-end web development best practices to follow.
         </p>
         <p>This chapter will discuss tools to accomplish both tasks from one build file.</p>
         <h2>What software we need</h2>
         <p>For this to work you need the following software installed:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>Java (version 1.7 or later)</li>
            <li>Node.js (0.10.35 or later)</li>
         </ul>
         <p>Once you have java installed, you can install the following Java package</p>
         <ul>
            <li>Saxon 9.0.6.4 for Java</li>
         </ul>
         <p>A note about Saxon: OxygenXML comes with a version of Saxon Enterprise Edition. We'll
            use a different version to make it easier to use outside the editor.
         </p>
         <p>Node packages are handled through NPM, the Node Package Manager. On the Node side
            we need at least the `grunt-cli` package installed globally. TO do so we use this
            command:
         </p>
         <pre>
            <code language="bash"> $ npm install -g grunt-cli </code>
         </pre>
         <p>The -g flag will install this globally, as opposed to installing it in the project
            directory.
         </p>
         <p>Now that we have the required sotfware installed we can move ahead and create our
            configuration files.
         </p>
         <h2>Optional: Ruby, SCSS-Lint and SASS</h2>
         <p>The only external dependencies you need to worry about are Ruby, SCSS-Lint and SASS.
            Ruby comes installe in most (if not all) Macintosh and Linux systems; an
            <a href="http://rubyinstaller.org/) is also available" label="installer for Windows">installer for Windows</a>.
         </p>
         <p>SASS (syntactically awesome style sheets) are a superset of CSS that brings to the
            table enhancements to CSS that make life easier for designers and the people who have
            to create the stylesheets. I've taken advantage of these features to simplify my stylesheets
            and to save myself from repetitive and tedious tasks.
         </p>
         <p>SASS, the main tool, is written in Ruby and is available as a Ruby Gem.</p>
         <p>To install SASS, open a terminal/command window and type:</p>
         <pre>
            <code language="bash"> $ gem install sass </code>
         </pre>
         <p>Note that on Mac and Linux you may need to run the command as a superuser. If you
            get an error, try the following command:
         </p>
         <pre>
            <code language="bash"> $ sudo gem install sass </code>
         </pre>
         <p>and enter your password when prompted.</p>
         <p>SCSS-Lint is a linter for the SCSS flavor of SASS. As with other linters it will detect
            errors and potential erors in your SCSS style sheets. As with SASS, SCSSLint is a
            Ruby Gem that can be installed with the following command:
         </p>
         <pre>
            <code language="bash"> $ sudo gem install scss-lint </code>
         </pre>
         <p>The same caveat about errors and installing as an administrator apply.</p>
         <blockquote>
            <p>Ruby, SCSS-Lint and SASS are only necessary if you plan to change the SCSS/SASS files.
               If you don't you can skip the Ruby install and work directly with the CSS files
            </p>
            <p>If you want to peek at the SASS source look at the files under the scss directory.</p>
         </blockquote>
         <h2>Installing Node packages</h2>
         <p>Grunt is a Node.js based task runner. It's a declarative version of Make and similar
            tools in other languages. Since Grunt and it's associated plugins are Node Packages
            we need to configure Node.
         </p>
         <p>At the root of the project there's a `package.json` file where all the files necessary
            for the project have already been configured. All that is left is to run the install
            command.
         </p>
         <pre>
            <code language="bash"> $ npm install </code>
         </pre>
         <p>This will install all the packages indicated in configuration file and all their dependencies;
            go get a cup of coffee as this may take a while in slower machines.
         </p>
         <p>As it installs the software it'll display a list of what it installed and when it's
            done you'll have all the packages.
         </p>
         <p>The final step of the node installation is to run bower, a front end package manager.
            It is not configured by default but you can use it to manage packages such as jQuery,
            Highlight.JS, Polymer web components and others.

         </p>
         <h2>Grunt &amp; Front End Development best practices</h2>
         <p>While developing the XML and XSL for this project, I decided that it was also a good
            chance to test front end development tools and best practices for styling and general
            front end development.
         </p>
         <p>One of the best known tools for front end development is Grunt. It is a Javascript
            task runner and it can do pretty much whatever you need to do in your development
            environment. The fact that Grunt is written in Javascript saves developers from having
            to learn another language for task management.

         </p>
         <p>Grunt has its own configuration file (`Gruntfile.js`) one of which is provided as
            a model for the project.
         </p>
         <p>As currently written the Grunt file provides the following functionality in the assigned
            tasks. Please note that the tasks with an asterisk have subtasks to perform specific
            functions. We will discuss the subtasks as we look at each portion of the file and
            its purpose.
         </p>

         <h2>Setup</h2>
         <p>The first thing we do is declare two variables (module and require) as global for
            JSLint and JSHint. Otherwise we'll get errors and it's not essential to declare them
            before they are used.
         </p>
         <p>We then wrap the Gruntfile with a self executing function as a deffensive coding strategy.</p>
         <p>When concatenating Javascript files there may be some that use strict Javascript and
            some that don't; With Javascript
            <a href="http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-hoisting-explained--net-15092" label="vriable hoisting">vriable hoisting</a> the use stric declaration would be placed at the very top of the concatenated file
            making all the scripts underneat use the strict declaration.
         </p>
         <p>When concatenating Javascript files there may be some that use strict Javascript and
            some that don't; With Javascript

            <a href="http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-hoisting-explained--net-15092" label="vriable hoisting">vriable hoisting</a> the use stric declaration would be placed at the very top of the concatenated file
            making all the scripts underneat use the strict declaration.
         </p>
         <p>The function wrap prevents this by making the use strict declaration local to the
            file where it was written. None of the other templates will be affected and they will
            still execute from the master stylesheet. It's not essential for Grunt drivers (Gruntfile.js
            in our case) but it's always a good habit to get into.
         </p>

            <code language="javascript">/*global module */
               /*global require */

         <p>Uglify allow us to concatenate our Javascript files and, if we choose to, further
            reduce the file size by mangling the code (See this [page](http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/mangle)
            for an explanation of what mangle is and does). I've chosen not to mangle the code
            to make it easier to read. May add it as an option for production deployments.
         </p>
         <h2>SASS and CSS</h2>
         <p>As mentioned elsewhere I chose to use the SCSS flavor of SASS because it allows me
            to do some awesome things with CSS that I wouldn't be able to do with CSS alone.
         </p>
         <p>The first task with SASS is convert it to CSS. For this we have two separate tasks.
            One for development (dev task below) where we pick all the files from the scss directory
            (the entire files section is equivalent to writing

            <em>scss/*.scss</em>) and converting them to files with the same name in the css directory.
         </p>
         <pre>
            <code language="javascript">      // SASS RELATED TASKS
               // Converts all the files under scss/ ending with .scss

         <p>I did consider adding

            <a href="https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-cssmin" label="cssmin">cssmin</a> but decided against it for two reasons:
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li>SASS already concatenates all the files when it imports files from the modules and
               partials directory so we're only working with one file for each version of the project
               (html and PDF)
            </li>
            <li>The only other file we'd have to add, normalize.css, is a third party library that
               I'd rather leave along rather than mess with.
            </li>
         </ul>
         <p>The

            <em>scsslint</em> task is a wrapper for the scss-lint Ruby Gem that must be installed on your system.
            It warns you of errors and potential errors in your SCSS stylesheets.
         </p>
         <p>We've chosen to force it to run when it finds errors. We want the linting tasks to
            be used as the developer's discretion, there may be times when vendor prefixes have
            to be used or where colors have to be defined multiple times to acommodate older browsers.

         </p>
         <pre>
            <code language="javascript">      // I've chosen not to fail on errors or warnings.

         <p>Grunt's

            <a href="https://github.com/nDmitry/grunt-autoprefixer" label="autoprefixer">autoprefixer</a> task uses the

            <a href="http://caniuse.com/" label="CanIUse">CanIUse</a> database to determine if properties need a vendor prefix and add the prefix if they
            do.
         </p>
         <p>This becomes important for older browsers or when vendors drop their prefix for a
            given property. Rather than having to keep up to date on all vendor prefixed properties
            you can tell autoprefixer what browsers to test for (last 2 versions in this case)
            and let it worry about what needs to be prefixed or not.
         </p>
         <pre>
            <code language="javascript">      autoprefixer: {

         <p>The last css task is the most complicated one.

            <a href="https://github.com/addyosmani/grunt-uncss" label="Uncss">Uncss</a> takes out whatever CSS rules are not used in our target HTML files.
         </p>
         <pre>
            <code language="javascript">      // CSS TASKS TO RUN AFTER CONVERSION
               // Cleans the CSS based on what's used in the specified files

         <p>This is not a big deal for our workflow as most, if not all, the CSS is designed for
            the tags and classes we've implemented but it's impossible for the SASS/CSS libraries
            to grow over time and become bloated.
         </p>
         <p>This will also become and issue when you decide to include third part libraries in
            projects implemented on top of our workflow. By running Uncss on all our HTML files
            except the file we'll pass to our PDF generator (docs.html) we can be assured that
            we'll get the smallest css possible.

         </p>
         <p>We skip out PDF source html file because I'm not 100% certain that Uncss can work
            with Paged Media CSS extensions. Better safe than sorry.

         <h2>Optional tasks</h2>
         <p>I've also created a set of optional tasks that are commented in the Grunt file but
            have been uncommented here for readability.
         </p>
         <p>The first optional task is a Coffeescript compiler.

            <a href="http://coffeescript.org/" label="Coffeescript">Coffeescript</a> is a scripting language that provides a set of useful features and that compiles
            directly to Javascript.
         </p>
         <p>I some times use Coffeescript to create scripts and other interactive content so it's
            important to have the compilation option available.

         <p>The following two tasks are for managing file transfers and uploads to different targets.</p>
         <p>One of the things I love from working on Github is that your project automatically
            gets an ssl-enabled site for free.

            <a href="https://pages.github.com/" label="Github Pages">Github Pages</a> work with any kind of static website; Github even offers an automatic site generator
            as part of our your project site.

         <p>For the puposes of our workflow validation we'll make a package of our content in
            a build directory and push it to the gh-pages branch of our repository. We'll look
            at building our app directory when we look at copying files.

         <p>We will use the mkdir and copy tasks to create a build directory and copy all css,
            js and html files to the build directory. We will then use the gh-pages task (described
