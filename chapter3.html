         <h1>Introduction</h1>
         <p>One of the biggest limitations of markup languages, in my opinion, is how confining
            they are. Even large vocabularies like

            <a href="http://docbook.org" label="Docbook">Docbook</a> are limited in what they can do out of the box. HTML4 is non-extensible and HTML5
            is limited in how you can extend it (web components are the only way to extend HTML5
            I'm aware of that doesn't require an update to the HTML specification.)
         </p>
         <p>By creating our own markup vocabulary we can be as expressive as we need to be without
            adding additional complexity for writers and users and without adding unecessary complexity
            for the developers building the tools to interact with the markup.
         </p>
         <h2>Why create our own markup</h2>
         <p>I have a few answers to that question:</p>
         <p>In creating your own xml-based markup you enforce separation of content and style.
            The XML document provides the basic content of the document and the hints to use elsewhere.
            XSLT stylesheets allow you to structure the base document and associated hints into
            any number of formats (for the purposes of this document we'll concentrate on XHTML,
            PDF created through Paged Media CSS and PDF created using XSL formatting Objects)

         </p>
         <p>Creating a domain specific markup vocabulary allows you think about structure and
            complexity for yourself as the editor/typesetter and for your authors. It makes you
            think about elements and attributes and which one is better for the given experience
            you want and what, if any, restrictions you want to impose on your makeup.
         </p>
         <p>By creating our own vocabulary we make it easier for authors to write clean and simple
            content. XML provides a host of validation tools to enforce the structure and format
            of the XML document.
         </p>
         <h2>Options for defining the markup</h2>
         <p>For the purpose of this project we'll define a set of resources that work with a book
            structure like the one below:
         </p>
         <pre>
            <code language="xml">&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
               &lt;book
               xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
               xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="xsd/book-schema-draft.xsd"&gt;
               &lt;metadata&gt;
               &lt;title&gt;Sample Document&lt;/title&gt;
               &lt;authors&gt;
               &lt;author&gt;
               &lt;first-name&gt;Carlos&lt;/first-name&gt;
               &lt;surname&gt;Araya&lt;/surname&gt;
               &lt;/author&gt;
               &lt;/authors&gt;
               &lt;/metadata&gt;
               &lt;section type="chapter"&gt;
               &lt;title&gt;Chapter 1&lt;/title&gt;

               &lt;para&gt;&lt;/para&gt;
               &lt;para&gt;&lt;/para&gt;
               &lt;para&gt;&lt;/para&gt;
               &lt;/section&gt;

               &lt;section type="chapter"&gt;
               &lt;title&gt;Chapter 2&lt;/title&gt;

               &lt;para&gt;&lt;/para&gt;
               &lt;para&gt;&lt;/para&gt;
               &lt;para&gt;&lt;/para&gt;
               &lt;/section&gt;
               &lt;/book&gt;
            </code>
         </pre>
         <p>It is not a complete structure. We will continue adding elements afte we reach the
            MVP (Minimum Viable Product) stage. As usual, feedback is always appreciated.
