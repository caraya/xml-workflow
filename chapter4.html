         <h1>Further Research</h1>
         <p>These are the things I want to look at after finishing mvp.</p>
         <h2>Deep Linking using Emphasis</h2>
         <p>The NYT developed a deep linking library called Emphasis (
            <a href="https://github.com/NYTimes/Emphasis" label="code">code</a> -
            <a href="http://open.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/11/emphasis-update-and-source/)" label="writeup">writeup</a>) that would allow us to create links to specific areas of our content.
         </p>
         <p>Downside is that it uses jQuery and I'm not certain I want to go through the pain
            in the ass process of converting it to plain JS or ES6 (and if it's even possible)
         </p>
         <p>Still, if we use jQuery for something else (video manipulation?) it may be worth exploring
            both as a sharing tool and as a technology.
         </p>
         <p>One thing it doesn't do is handle mobile well, if at all. How do we make this tool
            work everywhere?

         </p>
         <h2>Build Media Queries</h2>
         <p>Particularly if we want to use the same XSLT and CSS for mutliple projects we need
            to be able to tailor the display for different devices and viewports.
         </p>
         <p>Media Queries are the best solution (or are they?)</p>
         <h2>Using XSLT to build navigation</h2>
         <p>The same way we build the table of content should allow us to build navigation within
            the pages of a publication using preceeding-sibling and following-sibling logic
         </p>
         <h2>Create a better way to generate filenames</h2>
         <p>The current way to create filenames doesn't take into account that different `section/@type`
            elements have different starting values. Can I make it start from 1 for every @type
            in the document?
         </p>
         <h2>Expand the use cases for this project</h2>
         <p>The original idea was for text and code-heavy content. Is there a case to be made
            for a more expressive vocabulary? I'm thinking of additional elements for navigation
            and content display such as asides and blockquotes
